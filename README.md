## Introduction
![Overview of DNOIS](assets/overview.svg "Overview of DNOIS")

## Features
- Provides precise, standard, efficient and usable implementation for imaging simulation
- Covers the whole imaging pipeline in computational photography/imaging,
  from representation of scenes to output signal of simulated sensor.
- Simulates imaging in a differentiable manner, enabling end-to-end optimization.
- Supports diverse application scenarios and flexible options of optical systems.
